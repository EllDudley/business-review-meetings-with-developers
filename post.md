## Introduction

In all tech firms ranging from product startups to large IT service MNCs, all the developers are afraid of the word 'Business'. Also, business managers avoid to deal with Developers most of the time. Business is the soul of any organization, it is the sole purpose for existence of any enterprise. But any tech firm cannot work without the developers to build their product or provide services to their clients. Developers are the backbone for any technical organization. 

### Manager or a Developer, you must contribute in Business Decisions

### Business Plans & Strategic Planning

MBAs and wannabe Entrepreneurs tend to make ambitious technology based Business plans without even consulting any developer. If you are a developer, you must have heard from an Entrepreneur boasting about, we will reach **XX million users/customers** in just 1,2 or 3 years without even realising the feasibility of the tech solution. I have myself gone through several pages long detailed Business Plans which would have required hours of efforts to create where as a developer could tell in 2 hours that the idea is not feasible technically or if it requires some modification to be effective.

Even in well established companies, strategic planning and business decisions are taken in closed board rooms without consulting the actual people who will work for those goals and decisions.

## How Technology drives Business today

Technology has become an integral part of our lives and we cannot work a single day without technology. From large assembly lines in manufacturing units to small departmental stores technology forms the backbone of operations, marketing and sales. Every organization wether small or large today, has encompassed an internal IT department consisting of one or more developers of techies.

Developers form majority of the workforce in all Tech Firms and startups these days. Web Apps & Mobile Apps are at the vital core of any business strategy today. Enablement of business by technology can be envisaged by a true techie or developer at heart, so it is evident to involve them in your **Business Strategy Planning or Business Decisions**.

## Why developers should be involved in Business Decisions
I have given you enough, what we say in India 'Gyaan' [It means giving too much opinion without much facts.]. Now I want to enlist the facts or exact reasons, which I think why developers should absolutely be a part of the important decision making process in any Business.

### 1. Do feasibility analysis for any new Business Plans
Drawing huge mountains and buildings to showcase large dream softwares on your business plan for wowing VCs won't work unless your business plan has a stamp from a developer. A developer can only validate a technology based business plans. Business professionals tend to rely on their own models and limited research to forecast their software solutions to grow manyfolds without even asking for feasibility reports from their development or IT teams. Business growth should be well supported by your technology team and hence it is a necessity to get a signoff from them.

### 2. Providing Alternative Effective Ways
There is always another way to do that. Business Designs pave the path of success or failure for any institution. In any tech firms generally, important decisions are made for adding new features/products or services to the existing stack. The developers can contribute in providing insights to how those features/products or services can be effectively planned and later implemented perfectly. 

### 3. So that Developers are Well Informed for Better Performance
Developers will always perform better if they instill the objective of the solution or project in their work. If developers' are involved in the business decisions or even their reviews, it can increase their productivity manyfolds. For Example: If a developer has been in a business meeting, where the focus of a website's target audience for next few months is being decided, it can help the developer try to give utmost important to the features which would realize that business decision. 

### 4. Developers' can understand the Business and realize their importance
If a developer does not believe in the organization's vision and mission, he cannot add value through the work he does. In order to hit the bull's eye or even on the board, anyone needs to know about the target. Generally, developers are given small assignments and are rarely informed about the pursuit and purpose of the complete solution, product or company. 

I am taking the example of the Car Manufacturing process. The creation of a complex machine like car was traditionaly an art and rarely people could excel in it. The people who built complete cars on their own had pride and satisfaction in their works. Introduction to assembly lines introduced division of work and now a person who could make a car was handling only a small part of car manufacturing process like mounting wheels. Similarly, the work of developers has been made monotonous without involving them or informing them about important business decisions which can motivate them.

## Conclusion

I have myself worked in Small Startups with team size of 4-5 to large MNCs with strength of more than 35000+ employees and yet I would conclude that involving the people at the root like the developers is of utmost importance for sustenance and growth. I would suggest you to think on my points and try to implement effective engagement and feedback systems where everyone can participate in the important process of decision making in any business.
